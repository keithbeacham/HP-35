The HP-35 was the first pocket calculator designed for engineers. Introduced by Hewlett Packard in 1972 it became hugely successful. It is unusual in using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for input, a format which has since been superceded by algebraic notation.

This code simulates the HP-35. All functions have been implemented. The layout is correct but not a photographic likeness. It has been implemented in Javascript React, developed using Vite.

To run, download the repository and enter "npm i" then "npm run dev". The simulator can be displayed on a browser through a localhost port displayed by Vite when "npm run dev" is entered. To break out of Vite, use Ctrl-C.
